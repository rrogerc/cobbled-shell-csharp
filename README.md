# Cobbled Shell in C#
This is my implementation of a shell, following the [Codecrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/catalog) guide.

This uses .NET and to run it just run
```
./your_program
```

## Features
- `exit`, `echo`, `type` (will look into PATH), `pwd` commands
- run external programs using PATH environment variable
- `cd` with home, absolute, and relative paths
